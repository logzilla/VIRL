=== DHCP Relay Server ID Override and Link Selection Option 82 Suboptions ===

Standard IOS Only

Normally, DHCP relay sends traffic to the DHCP server using its own IP address in the subnet 
as the source. It also includes it in the "giaddr" of the DHCP REQUEST frame.
This means that the DHCP server must be able to send the frame back to the source subnet.

This is not always possible or desirable. Cisco works around this limitation by using sub option of DHCP option 82. These sub options 
are a Cisco standard and may not be understood by a non Cisco DHCP server.

The DHCP relay will use an address that is reachable by the DHCP server as source of the packet 
and as "giaddr". It will insert in Option 82 a server-id-override suboption (152) which includes 
the ip address in the target subnet. When the request is received by the server, it uses the
server-id-override field to allocate an address and sends the reply to the giaddr address.

=== DHCP Relay MPLS VPN Support ===

In MPLS, where the client and server reside in different VRFs/VPNs, the relay must also be 
configured to send to the server the VRF name or VPN id using the "ip dhcp relay information 
option vpn" command. The server DHCP pools must be configured with the target VRF/VPN id.
