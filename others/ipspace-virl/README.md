# Sample VIRL Topologies

This repository contains VIRL topologies discussed in various blog posts
on [blog.ipSpace.net](http://blog.ipspace.net/):

* **ARP across subnets**: test how ICMP redirects and proxy ARP work across subnets
* **BGP Route Maps**: contains various tests described in [this blog post](http://blog.ipspace.net/2016/05/bgp-route-maps-and-continue-feature.html).
* **Inter-AS**: Emulates access + core AS networks described in [Optimal Inter-AS Routing Challenge](http://blog.ipspace.net/2016/11/optimal-inter-as-routing-challenge.html). Also used in various Ansible examples.
* **OSPF-Forwarding-Address** and **OSPF-Forwarding-Address-Bandwidth-Mismatch** explore the intricacies of OSPF Forwarding Address behavior
