Topology description
--------------------
1 IOSv router, 1 CSR1000v, 1 IOS XRv, 1 NXOSv, 1 ASAv, 1 IOSvL2 and one Linux server

This is a test topology with 6 nodes, connected in a ring. An IOSvL2 switch instance provides multi-point connectivity between the NXOSv, CSR1000v and Linux Server.

Nodes are not set with any configuration attributes, so nodes will be configured for IPv4, OSPF and BGP full-mesh.
