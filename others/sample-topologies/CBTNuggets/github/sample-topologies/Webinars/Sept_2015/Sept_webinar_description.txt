Topology Description---------------------Two simulations - 1 Server VM, 1 IOSv router in eachFLAT connectors are introduced to the topology to extend connectivity from simulated nodes to physical devices. The FLAT cloud connectors represent networks 172.16.1.0/24 and 172.16.2.0/24. In this demo we connect two simulations [RTP_Sim1.virl] and [SJC_Sim2.virl] using a common link; FLAT1 (172.16.2.0/24) network. We also demonstrate how to use the FLAT (172.16.1.0/24) network for OOB management of the RTP_Sim1 topology. By using the FLAT network for OOB management, we are now able to leverage that connection to install web services on Server-1 running in RTP_Sim1. After installing web services on Server-1 and adjusting our routes within the simulation, we can then connect to the web page from Server-2 and from physical nodes in our network. Basic understanding of routing and VLANs is assumed for this demo.
